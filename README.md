# streamgraph
Draw a customizable streamgraph based on emoji counts. Visualize emoji-use and overall sentiment with a beautiful stream graph.

You have the option to choose between Plotly or Altair. Both come with their strong points and setbacks.

Use 001_EXTRACT_EMOJIS and 002_ to prepare and process your data.

For privacy reasons I did not include the original chat, only the .CSV that I extracted. Feel free to play around with the data.

Enjoy !
